Hey! I'm Ed, I'm a software developer from London.

I like to build things with Python and Django, and modern frontend JavaScript frameworks.
I like using Docker, Terraform and CI/CD pipelines to take my projects to production.

This site contains documentation and notes on things I'm learning about and useful code snippets.

There are links to more information about me, my portfolio and contact information at the top of the page.
