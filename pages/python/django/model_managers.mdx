# Model Managers

Extend the base Manager class of a model to add/or to modify the initial QuerySet the Manager returns.

There are two main advantages of this:
  1. Clarity: The implementation detail of the filter can be abstracted away, making logic easier to read.
  2. Consistency: The same filter can be reused reducing the risk of differing implementations in the codebase.

```python filename="managers.py" showLineNumbers copy
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce

class PollManager(models.Manager):
    def with_counts(self):
        return self.annotate(
            num_responses=Coalesce(models.Count("response"), 0)
        )
```

```python filename="models.py" showLineNumbers copy
from django.db import models
from polls.managers import PollManager

class OpinionPoll(models.Model):
    question = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    objects = PollManager()

class Response(models.Model):
    poll = models.ForeignKey(OpinionPoll, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

```python filename="usage.py" showLineNumbers copy
OpinionPoll.objects.with_counts()
```
