Pre-Commit Hooks
================

## Introduction

Implementing these tools is helpful for several key reasons, including:

- **Uniform Code Formatting**: By standardizing aspects like line breaks and indentation, these tools make it easier to understand and navigate unfamiliar code, reducing the effort needed to comprehend it.

- **Fewer Merge Conflicts**: Consistency in formatting leads to a significant reduction in merge conflicts, simplifying code integration and collaboration.

- **Enhanced Code Quality**: When your code looks clean and well-organized, it sets a quality standard that encourages the development of high-quality logic and functionality.

- **Early Bug Detection**: Automated static analysis tools are effective in identifying potential bugs and issues early in the development cycle, long before the code reaches a pull request or a production environment.

By incorporating these automated tools into your workflow, you'll not only improve the readability and maintainability of your code but also enhance the overall development process.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ensure **Python** is installed on your machine.
- Make sure your project is using **Git** for version control.

### 1. Install pre-commit

Install the `pre-commit` framework via pip.

```bash
# Useful to add this to your dev requirements too
pip install pre-commit
```

### 2. Configure pre-commit for Your Project

Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your Git repository

Here is an example with some useful hooks:

```yaml filename=".pre-commit-config.yaml" showLineNumbers copy
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace

  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.12.0
    hooks:
      - id: isort
        args: [ '--profile', 'black' ]

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.11.0
    hooks:
      - id: black

  - repo: https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs
    rev: 1.16.0
    hooks:
    -   id: blacken-docs
        types: [markdown, mdx]
        additional_dependencies:
        - black==23.11.0
```

### 3. Install the pre-commit Hooks

Run the following command in your repository:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will set up the hooks to run automatically before each `git commit`.

### 4. Optional: Run Hooks Against All Files

Run the hooks against all the files in your project (useful for existing projects):

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 5. Commit Changes

If the hooks made any modifications, stage and commit these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Apply Black and isort formatting"
```

### 6. Collaboration and Continuous Integration

- Ensure every team member has pre-commit installed, and the hooks set up.

## Introducing Formatting to an Existing Project

### Using `.git-blame-ignore-revs` for Linting Commits

When introducing new linting rules in pre-commit hooks,
a large number of files might get reformatted.

This can clutter the Git history, particularly affecting the usefulness of `git blame`.

The `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file helps to mitigate this issue by telling
`git blame` to ignore certain commits.

### Steps to Implement `.git-blame-ignore-revs`

#### 1. Perform the Linting

Run the new linters/formatters on your codebase and commit the changes. This will likely result in a large commit.

#### 2. Create `.git-blame-ignore-revs` File

Create a new file in your repository named `.git-blame-ignore-revs`. This file will list the commits that should be ignored by `git blame`.

#### 3. Add the Linting Commit Hash

Find the commit hash of your linting commit using `git log`, and add it to the `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file. Optionally, add a comment for clarity.

```plaintext
# Black formatting
abc1234def56789ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

*Replace the example hash with your actual commit hash.*

#### 4. Configure Git to Recognize the File

Run the following command to configure Git to use the `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file:

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

### Benefits

- **Maintains a Cleaner Git History**: Helps `git blame` to show more relevant historical information, ignoring massive formatting changes.

- **Improves Code Reviews**: Focus remains on substantive changes rather than formatting adjustments.

### Best Practices

- **Document the Usage**: Ensure to document this in your project guidelines so all team members are aware.

- **Use Only for Major Refactorings**: This should be reserved for commits with non-functional changes like reformatting.

By incorporating `.git-blame-ignore-revs` in your project, you preserve the effectiveness of `git blame` for tracking meaningful changes, even after introducing substantial linting modifications.
