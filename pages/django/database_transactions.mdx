Django Database Transactions
============================

Django's default behaviour is to run in autocommit mode.  Each query is immediately commited to the database.

Django uses transactions or savepoints automatically to guarantee the integrity of ORM operations that require
multiple queries, especially `delete()` and `update()` queries.

Django's `TestCase` class also wraps each test in a transaction for performance reasons.

## Atomic Requests

A common way to handle transactions on the web is to wrap each request in a transaction.
Set `ATOMIC_REQUESTS` to True in the database configuration.

Therefore, before calling a view function, Django starts a transaction.  If the response is produced without problems,
Django commits the transaction.  If the view produces an exception, Django rolls back the transaction.

This behaviour can be overriden using a decorator:

```python showLineNumbers copy
from django.db import transaction

@transaction.non_atomic_requests
def my_view(request):
    # do_stuff()
    ...

@transaction.non_atomic_requests(using='other')
def my_other_view(request):
    # do_stuff_on_the_other_database()
    ...
```

## Controlling transactions

Atomicity is the defining property of database transactions.  `atomic` allows us to create
a block of code with which the atomicity on the database is guaranteed. If the block of code is successfully completed,
the changes are committed to the database.  If there is an exception, the changes are rolled back.

Django provides a single API to control database transactions.

```python showLineNumbers
from django.db.transaction import atomic

atomic(using=None, savepoint=True, durable=False)
```

As a decorator:
```python showLineNumbers copy
from django.db import transaction

@transaction.atomic
def viewfunc(request):
    # This code executes inside a transaction
    ...
```

As a context manager:
```python showLineNumbers copy
from django.db import transaction

def viewfunc(request):
    # Here executes in autocomit mode (Django's default).
    ...
    with transaction.atomic():
        # Executes inside a transaction.
        ...
```

Using a try/except block to allow for natural handling of integrity errors.
```python showLineNumbers copy
from django.db import IntegrityError, transaction

@transaction.atomic
def viewfunc(request):

    create_parent()

    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            generate_relationships()
    except IntegrityError:
        handle_exception()

    add_children()
```
Here, if the inner transaction fails it will have been safely rolled back by the exception handler.\
The `create_parent()` and `add_children()` logic is not affected.
