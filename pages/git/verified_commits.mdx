## Resolving GPG Email Mismatch Issues

### Why This Happens

#### GPG Key Email Mismatch
- Each GPG key is associated with one or more email addresses. If the email address in the commit doesn't match the email addresses linked to the GPG key, verification fails.

#### Different Emails for Personal and Work Accounts
- Using different emails for personal and work-related commits can lead to mismatches if the GPG key is not configured with the correct email.

#### Vigilant Mode in GitHub
- GitHub's "vigilant mode" requires all commits to be signed with a GPG key that matches the committer's email, enhancing security.

### How to Resolve the Issue

#### Option 1: Add the Organizational Email to Your GPG Key

1. **Edit the GPG Key:**
   ```bash
   gpg --edit-key <your-key-id>
   ```

2. **Add a New Email:**
   ```bash
   adduid
   ```
   Follow the prompts to add your organizational email.

3. **Save the Changes:**
   ```bash
   save
   quit
   ```

4. **Update GitHub with the Updated GPG Key:**
   Export the updated key:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export <your-key-id>
   ```
   Add the key to GitHub under [GPG Keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).

#### Option 2: Use a Separate GPG Key for Organizational Work

1. **Generate a New GPG Key:**
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```
   Use your work email during the setup process.

2. **List GPG Keys to Obtain the Key ID:**
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
   ```

3. **Configure Git to Use the New Key:**
   Set the `user.signingkey` in your work repo:
   ```bash
   git config user.email "your-work-email@example.com"
   git config user.signingkey <new-work-key-id>
   ```

4. **Add the New GPG Key to GitHub:**
   Export the new key and add it to GitHub:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export <new-work-key-id>
   ```
   Add it to [GitHub GPG Keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).

#### Option 3: Manually Configure the Committer Email

Ensure that the email used in your commits matches the one linked with your GPG key. You can set this in your repository:

```bash
git config user.email "matching-email@example.com"
```

### Why It's Important

- **Security:** Ensuring the email addresses match is critical for maintaining the integrity of your commits.
- **Vigilant Mode:** This mode enforces strict identity verification, protecting your codebase's security.
